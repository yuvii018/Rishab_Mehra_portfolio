# Pierre Dupont — Tutor Portfolio (Template)

This is a minimal, responsive single-page portfolio template for a French tutor. It includes:

- Hero, About, Lessons, and Contact sections
- Instagram button and phone call button
- Simple contact form (client-side only)

To view locally:

```powershell
# Open index.html in your browser (Windows)
start .\index.html
```

Notes:
- Replace the placeholder Instagram link in `index.html` with the tutor's real handle.
- Replace the phone number in `index.html` with the tutor's real contact.
- For production contact handling, add a server endpoint to receive the form data.
